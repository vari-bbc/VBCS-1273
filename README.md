There are four total files:
Social distancing fullscreen analysis
Social distancing validation analysis
Activity fullscreen analysis
Activity validation analysis
The validation files are compatible with both the MiMIC and Trojan backgrounds. 
The activity validation analysis requires the PCA output from the activity fullscreen analysis, since it uses the same rotation matrix to maintain consistency and comparability. 
As a result, the fullscreen analyses must be run first.
